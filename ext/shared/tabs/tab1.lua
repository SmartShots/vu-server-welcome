# Welcome to ‚≠ê Superturds Competitive Server
<br>

The base vu-extension we are running here is called **promod**. Basically **Attackers** need to kill all enemies or plant the bomb before the timer runs out. **Defenders** need to defend both bombsites or wait for the timer to run down.
<br>

### How to plant the bomb
As Attacker, find your way to one of the 2 bomb sites,
aim at the bomb and hold [INTERACT], by default that's [E].
<br>

### How to defuse the bomb
As Defender, find your way to the active bomb,
aim at the laptop and hold [INTERACT], by default that's [E].
