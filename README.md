# VU Server Welcome Screen MOD
VU _/vi:ju:/_ is a community-oriented Battlefield 3 modding platform that gives you back control of your gaming experience ([LINK](https://veniceunleashed.net/)). `vu-server-welcome` is a simple VU extension for server owners to welcome joining players. 

âš¡ **WORK IN PROGRESS** My mod is a fork based on [this original MOD](https://github.com/turbopasi/vu-welcome-screen) and is still in development.

See original MOD for existing features and configuration, my current additions to those features are as follows:

1 - Changed the size/position of the 'CLOSE' button as it was causing interference with the underlying BF 3 UI.

2 - Added a subtle background texure behind the welcome screen UI to further separate it from the underlying BF 3 UI.
